# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; APIs
###### Project Overview
- Purpose
    - Visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
- Tasks
    - Use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. 
    - Then add the data to a map.
- Approach
    - Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
    - Then use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
